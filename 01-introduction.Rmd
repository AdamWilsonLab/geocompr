# Introduction {#intro}

This book is about harnessing the power of modern computers to *do things* with geographic data.
It teaches a range of spatial skills, including: reading, writing and manipulating geographic data; making static and interactive maps; and modelling geographic data.
By joining together various spatial operations in scripts and functions, the book shows how these skills can be used as part of a reproducible workflow.
Not only will you learn how to use existing tools.
By the end of the book you should have an idea of how to create new ones, that can be implemented as new functions for others to use.

Over the last few decades a huge amount of work has gone into developing free and open source software for geospatial applications (FOSS4G).
This means that spatial data analysis is no longer the preserve of those who can afford expensive programs, and the hardware to run them.
Anyone can now download high performance spatial libraries on their computer.
However, despite the growth of geospatial software that is *open source*, much of it is still not *accessible* and requires expert knowledge to use.

A major aim of this book is to make geographical data analysis more accessible.
R is flexible language that allows access to many spatial software libraries (see section \@ref(why-geocomputation-with-r)).
Before going into the details of the software, however, it is worth taking a step back and thinking about what we mean by geocomputation.

## What is geocomputation?

What defines geocomputation as a development on previous work its emphasis on "creative and experimental" applications that a computational perspective enables [@longley_geocomputation:_1998].
It is also about developing new methods [@openshaw_geocomputation_2000]:

> GeoComputation is about using the various different types of geodata and about
developing relevant geo-tools within the overall context of a 'scientific'
approach.

R is a [functional language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html) [@wickham_advanced_2014] with many 'bridges' that allow access to a treasure trove of GIS algorithms.
<!-- todo - add this reference to end of previous line: -->
<!-- (\@ref(gis)). -->
It is thus ideal for quickly creating 'geo-tools', without needing to master low level languages such as C, FORTRAN and Java. 

But geocomputation is not just about the methods and code: it is about doing
"practical work that is beneficial or useful" [@openshaw_geocomputation_2000].
After reading this book you should be able to do more than just *understand* geocomputational methods or *follow* the reproducible examples implemented in code chunks in each chapter.
This book is about *doing* geocomputation.
This means applying the methods you have learned (and skills you will master) on real-world data to solve pressing problems for social and environmental benefit.

Geocomputation is a relatively young field^[Geocomputation has a ~30 year history dating back to the first [conference](http://www.geocomputation.org/) on the subject in 1996 (at the University of Leeds where the concept for this book was dreamt up) which was followed by a flurry of subsequent publications.] but algorithms published under the geocomputational banner have influenced the direction of geographical research, as we will see in subsequent chapters.
<!-- todo: which chapters? -->
Algorithms are powerful tools that can become highly complex.
However, all algorithms are composed of smaller parts.
By teaching these foundations we aim to empower you to create your own solutions to geographic data problems. This can feel like breaking free from the metaphorical 'glass ceiling' imposed by GUI-based proprietary geographic information systems (see Table \@ref(tab:gdsl) for a definition of GUI).

<!-- todo: what contributions, which will we use, where in the book? -->

While embracing recent developments in the field, we also wanted to pay respects to the wider field of Geography, with its 2000 history [@roller_eratosthenes_2010], and the narrower field of *Geographic Information System* (GIS) [@neteler_open_2008].
Geography has played an important role in explaining and influencing humanity's relationship with the natural world and this book aims to be a part of the 'Geographic tradition'.
GIS has become almost synonymous with handling spatial data on a computer, and provides a basis for excellent open source tools which can be accessed from R, as we will see in Chapter 13.

The book's links to older disciplines were reflected in suggested titles for the book: *Geography with R* and *R for GIS*.
Each has advantages.
The former conveys the message that it's not just about spatial data: 
non-spatial attribute data are inevitably interwoven with geometry data, and Geography is about more than where something is on the map.
The latter communicates that this is a book about using R as a GIS, to perform spatial operations on *geographic data* [@bivand_applied_2013].
However, the term GIS has some negative connotations <!-- I see what you mean by negative connotations but I had to think immediately of qualitative GIS and critical GIS, i.e., scientists from the humanities criticising GIS technologies. Think of the so-called "GIS crisis", positivism, make-believe objectivity, etc.--> (see Table \@ref(tab:gdsl)) and fails to communicate one of R's greatest strengths:
its unparalleled ability to seamlessly switch between geographic and non-geographic data processing, modeling and visualization tasks.

Geocomputation in this book therefore means more than simply analyzing geographic data on a computer.
It's about trying to make research which involves making geographic data more reproducible, scientific and socially beneficial.
This book is also part of the movement towards Geographic Data Science (GDS) which differs from GIS in several ways, some of which are outlined in Table \@ref(tab:gdsl).
Inspired by the emphasis of GDS research on reproducible research, this book aims to teach how to do geocomputation rather than just think about it.

```{r gdsl, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
d = readr::read_csv("extdata/gis-vs-gds-table.csv")
knitr::kable(x = d, caption = "Differences in emphasis between the fields of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Geographic Data Science (GDS).")
```

## Why Geocomputation with R?

In this book we treat R as a 'tool for the trade'.
Early geographers used a variety of tools including rulers, compasses and sextants to advance knowledge about the world. 
<!--nowadays part-->
It is important to remember that while R is a powerful tool, especially when interfaced with other software such as [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) and [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/), other tools may be better for certain tasks. <!-- What exactly do you mean? Which tasks? Is there a geocomputational task for which we do not have an interface? So maybe rephrase along the lines that R is not a GIS and therefore not suited for some geoprocessing tasks but that interfaces close this gap. -->

R is characterized by its flexibility, enabling geographical software developers to extend it in multiple ways.
A good example of this is support for generating interactive maps thanks to **leaflet** [@R-leaflet], which has been subsequently built-on by **tmap** and **mapview** [@R-tmap; @R-mapview].
These packages help overcome the criticism that R has "limited interactive [plotting] facilities" [@bivand_applied_2013].
This is no longer true, as illustrated by the code below which generates Figure \@ref(fig:interactive).

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
a = osmdata::getbb("Hereford")
b = osmdata::getbb("Bialystok")
rowMeans(a)
rowMeans(b)
```

```{r interactive, fig.cap="World at night imagery from NASA overlaid by the authors' approximate home locations to illustrate interactive mapping with R."}
library(leaflet)
popup = c("Robin", "Jakub")
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles("NASAGIBS.ViirsEarthAtNight2012") %>% 
  addAwesomeMarkers(lng = c(-3, 23), lat = c(52, 53), popup = popup)
```

It would be difficult to produce Figure \@ref(fig:interactive) with only 4 lines of code in another language, let alone embed the results in an interactive html page (the interactive version can be viewed at [robinlovelace.net/geocompr](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/intro.html)), illustrating R's flexibility. 

<!-- Other reasons for using R for geocompuation include: -->

R provides a stable language that behaves consistently across multiple computers, free of charge.
The use of R code therefore enables teaching geocomputation with reference to reproducible examples such as that provided in \@ref(fig:interactive) rather than abstract concepts.
But before cracking-on with the action, a few introductory remarks are needed to explain the approach taken here and provide context.

## R's spatial ecosystem

<!-- paragraphs (with references to chapters in the book): -->
<!-- 1. this book focus -> sf + raster/stars + leaflet/mapview (the recent state of spatial R); the history of R spatial is way longer -->

There are many ways to handle spatial data in R, with dozens of packages in the area.^[An overview of R's spatial ecosystem can be found in the CRAN Task View on the Analysis of Spatial Data
(see [cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html)).]
In this book we endeavour to teach the state-of-the-art in the field whilst ensuring that the methods are future-proof.
Like many areas of software development, R's spatial ecosystem is rapidly evolving.
Because R is open source, these developments can easily build on previous work, by 'standing on the shoulders of giants', as Isaac Newton put it in [1675](http://digitallibrary.hsp.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/9285).
This approach is advantageous because it encourages collaboration and avoids 'reinventing the wheel'.
The package **sf** (covered in Chapter \@ref(spatial-class)), for example, builds on its predecesor **sp**.

Shifts in R's spatial ecosystem have been influenced by shifts in the wider R community, as exemplified by the visualisation and data processing packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr** (released in [2007](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/ggplot2/) and [2014](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dplyr/) respectively).
Alongside other packages that have a shared style and emphasis on 'tidy data', these were placed in the **tidyverse** 'metapackage' in late [2016](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/tidyverse/).
The **tidyverse** approach, with its focus on long-form data and fast, intuitively named function, has become immensely popular.
This has led to demand for 'tidy spatial data' which has been partly met by **sf** and other approaches such as the GitHub package [**tabularaster**](https://hypertidy.github.io/tabularaster/).
Another feature of the **tidyverse**, which was already present in the trio of packages that **sf** supercedes (**sp**, **rgeos** and **rgdal**), is the tendency for packages to work in harmony.
Although there is presently no equivalent **geoverse**, there are a growing number of actively developed package which are designed to work in harmony with **sf** (Table \@ref(tab:revdep)) and discussion of harmonization among R's many spatial packages.^[
See the [r-spatial](https://github.com/r-spatial/) organisation and conversations in the [discussion](https://github.com/r-spatial/discuss/issues/11) repo for more on this.
]

```{r revdep, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
top_dls = readr::read_csv("extdata/top_dls.csv")
knitr::kable(top_dls[1:5, 1:2], digits = 0, caption = paste0("The top 5 most downloaded packages that depend on sf, in terms of average number of downloads per day over the previous month. As of ", min(top_dls$date), " there are ", nrow(top_dls), " packages which import sf."))
# cranlogs::cran_top_downloads(when = "last-month") # most downloaded pkgs
```

A surge in development time (and interest) in 'R-Geo' has followed the award of a grant by the R Consortium for the development of support for Simple Features and the resulting **sf** package (covered in \@ref(intro-sf)).
This is illustrated in multiple places, not least the [R-sig-Geo Archives](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/), a long-standing open access email list containing much R-spatial wisdom accumulated over the years.
Many posts on the list now discuss **sf** and related packages, suggesting that R's spatial software developers are using the package and, therefore, it is here to stay.

We propose that the release of **sf** heralds a new era for spatial data analysis and geocomputation in R.
This era (which we refrain from labeling the **geoverse** with any seriousness, awaiting a better name!) clearly has the wind in its sails and is set to dominate future developments in R's spatial ecosystem for years to come.
So time invested in learning the 'new ways' of handling spatial data and, hopefully, reading this book, is well spent!

```{r cranlogs, fig.cap="The popularity of spatial packages in R. The y axis shows the average number of downloads, within a 30 day rolling window, of R's top 5 spatial packages, defined as those with the highest number of downloads within the last 30 days.", echo=FALSE}

```

## The history of geocomputing with R

There are many benefits of using recent packages such as **sf**, with the caveat that they are generally less stable than mature packages such as **sp**.
This is captured by the saying "if you live on the cutting edge you risk getting hurt", meaning that older packages may be more appropriate for applications requiring stability and backwards-compatibility with other mature packages.
Another reason for knowing about the history of geocomputation with R is that there is a wealth of functions, use-cases and teaching material written using older packages in R's spatial ecosystem, which can still be useful today provided you know where to look.

The beginnings of spatial capabilities in R are closely connected with its predecessor - the S language [@bivand_implementing_2000].
The 1990s saw the development of numerous S scripts and a handful of packages for spatial statistics.
Some of these, including **spatial**, **sgeostat** and **splancs**,  eventually became R packages [@rowlingson_splancs:_1993; @rowlingson_splancs:_2017;@venables_modern_2002; @university_sgeostat:_2016].

Volume 1/2 of R News (the predecessor of The R Journal) contained an overview of spatial statistical software in R at the time, much of which was based on previous code written for S/S-PLUS [@ripley_spatial_2001].
This overview described packages for spatial smoothing and interpolation (e.g. **akima**, **spatial**, **sgeostat** and **geoR**) and point pattern analysis (**splancs** and **spatstat**) [@akima_akima:_2016; @rowlingson_splancs:_2017; @jr_geor:_2016].
While all these are still available on CRAN, **spatstat** stands out among them, as it remains dominant in the field of spatial point pattern analysis [@baddeley_spatial_2015].

The subsequent issue of R News also put spatial packages in the spotlight, with an introduction **splancs** and commentary on future prospects [@bivand_more_2001].
Notably, the paper mentions the need for standardization of spatial interfaces, efficient mechanisms for exchanging data with GIS, and handling of spatial metadata such as coordinate reference systems (CRS).
Two years later, he presented an extended review of existing R spatial packages at the 3rd International Workshop on Distributed Statistical Computing (DSC 2003) [@hornik_approaches_2003]. 
At this stage, R spatial development started to be connected with the advancement in spatial software libraries, especially the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and PROJ.4.
They allow reading and writing vector and raster data formats, and conversions between coordinate reference systems. 
Based on the data types offered by GDAL, Bivand also proposed a basis for spatial data classes in R, with the fundamental types of spatial data highlighted - point, line, polygon and grid.
This idea was converted into a reality with creation of two, very closely connected R packages - **rgdal** and **sp**.

The first one, **rgdal** was released on CRAN in 2003 and provided an interface to GDAL and the PROJ.4 libraries [@R-rgdal].
It gave unmatched abilities to read and write dozens of different spatial data formats.
Importantly, it enabled storing information about coordinate reference system and allowed for map projection and datum transformation.

The second one, **sp**, was created in 2003-2004 and its first version was released on CRAN in 2005. 
This package was an answer to the major R spatial shortcoming - inability to distinguish spatial and non-spatial objects, as prior to the creation of **sp**, spatial coordinates were treated as numbers. 
**sp** provided classes and methods for spatial data. 
Spatial objects in this package could be represented as a one of four **sp** structures - points, lines, polygons and grids, all of which had two version - with and without attribute data. <!--???-->
<!-- points, multipoints, pixels, full grid, line, lines, spatial lines, polygon, polygons, spatial polygons -->
These objects were built using S4 classes, where all the information (such as bounding box, coordinate reference system, attribute table) were stored in specific slots.
Attribute data in **sp** were represented as `data.frame`, which enabled users to do non-spatial processing, for example data subsetting or manipulation.
Equally Important, this package also implemented a set of spatial methods.
For example, it allowed for spatial summary and retrieval of spatial information, such as a number of dimensions, bounding box or spatial coordinates of the data.
The **sp** package together with **rgdal** made possible transformations between coordinate reference systems and provided mapping capabilities using either the base plotting system or the lattice system.

The organization of spatial data in the **sp** package rapidly become an R spatial standard.
This resulted in a growing number of R packages built upon **sp**. 
About twenty packages depended **sp** by 2008, about one hundred by 2013 and more than 125 in 2017 [@bivand_applied_2013].
On top of that, now about 220 packages imports some functions from the **sp** package. 
<!-- https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues/58 -->
<!-- https://github.com/edzer/sfr/issues/387#issuecomment-308949140 -->
Some of the most prominent R packages using **sp** are: **gstat** - a set of functions for spatial and spatio-temporal geostatistics, **geosphere** used for spherical trigonometry, and **adehabitat** used for the analysis of habitat selection by animals [@R-gstat; @calenge_package_2006; @hijmans_geosphere:_2016].

**rgdal** and **sp** overcome many spatial R shortcomings, however R still lacked a geometry calculation abilities.
A robust geometry engine to R was added as a part of Google Summer of Code 2010 with creation of the **rgeos** package [@R-rgeos].
It integrated spatial object from **sp** with the spatial functions and operators from the GEOS library.

Although **sp** provided a possibility of reading and processing grid data, its raster capabilities were limited. 
A new **raster** package was created in 2010 to fill this gap [@R-raster].
It established new spatial classes for raster objects and added functions for creating, reading and writing raster data.
Very important feature of **raster** was its ability to work with raster dataset that are too large to be fitted in RAM.
Moreover, it implemented raster algebra, general raster functions and gave tools for development of more specific raster functions.

Simultaneously with the development of spatial classes and methods, R started to be used as an interface to several GIS software.
The most popular early example was the **GRASS** package [@bivand_using_2000].
Its first version was released in 2000 and it enabled a connection between R and GRASS GIS 5.0.
In the latter years, two new packages were published after the release of new GRASS GIS versions: **spgrass6** for GRASS GIS 6 and **rgrass7** for GRASS GIS 7 [@bivand_spgrass6:_2016;@bivand_rgrass7:_2016].
Other examples of bridges between R and GIS include RSAGA ([@R-RSAGA]; the first release in 2008), ArcGIS ([@brenning_arcgis_2012]; 2008) and RQGIS ([@R-RQGIS]; 2016).
<!-- ADD THIS LATTER -->
<!-- More information about interfaces between R and GIS software could be find in \@ref(gis). -->

**sp** provided methods for plotting data using the two existing systems - base and lattice.
However, a demand for convenient methods for spatial data visualizations rose with an increase in R spatial possibilities. 
In 2007, the third system, **ggplot2**, was published.
It gave a possibility to convert spatial objects from **sp** into `data.frames` to plot them. <!--2009-->
**ggplot2** spatial capabilities were improved in 2011 with the release of its associated package - **ggmap**, which provided several tools for spatial data visualization [@kahle_ggmap:_2013].
Among others, it allowed to create plots with static maps from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap as the base layer and gave access to the several spatial APIs, for example the Google Geocoding.
In the same year, the support of the lattice system was added to the raster objects with publication of the **rasterVis** package.
The wide range of visualization methods for numerical and categorical raster data, univariate and mutlivariate raster datasets and spatiotemporal rasters was provided in this package [@lamigueiro_displaying_2014]. 

Moreover, several packages were develop with a main goal of creation of complex, ready-to-use map with only a few lines of code.
The **tmap** package was released in 2014 and enabled creation of thematic maps [@R-tmap]. 
<!-- ADD THIS LATTER -->
<!-- CITE the paper Tennekes, M. (2017) tmap: Thematic Maps in R. Forthcoming in the Journal
of Statistical Software http://von-tijn.nl/tijn/research/presentations/tmap_user2017.pdf-->
Using this package, they could be generated based on the spatial objects and its layout is optimized for maps with the use of legends, scale bars, grid lines, north arrows, etc.
On the other hand, the **leaflet** package (released in 2015) offered creation and modification of interactive maps [@R-leaflet]. 
It is a wrapper of the "Leaflet" JavaScript library, which output can be used on websites, R Markdown documents and Shiny apps.
Additionally, the **mapview** package was created on top of **leaflet** [@R-mapview]. 
It enabled quick creation of interactive visualization of spatial data containing variety of background maps, dynamic scale bar, feature attributes viewer and more.

Nowadays, about 200 spatial packages exists in R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html).
The most important recent evolution in R's spatial ecosystem has without doubt been support for simple features thanks to the **sf** package [@R-sf], described in Chapter \@ref(spatial-class).
