  abstract = {Geocomputation is essentially the follow-on revolution from Geographic Information Science and is expected to gather speed and momentum in the first decade of the 21st century. It comes into use once a GIS database has been set up, with a digital data library, and expanded and linked to a global geographical two or three dimensional co-ordinate system. It exploits developments in IT and new data gathering and earth observing technologies, and takes the notion of GIS beyond data and towards its analysis, modelling, and use in problem solving. This book provides pointers on how to harness these technologies in tandem and in the context of multiple different subjects and problem areas. It seeks to establish the principles and set the foundations for subsequent growth.L},

  abstract = {Ever-increasing numbers of large demographic data sets are becoming available. Many of these data sets are provided as open data, but are in basic repositories where it is incumbent on the user to generate their own visualisations and analysis in order to garner insights. In a bid to facilitate the use and exploration of such data sets, we have created a web mapping platform called DataShine. We link data from the 2011 Census for England and Wales with open geographical data to demonstrate the power and utility of creating a conventional map and combining it with a simple but flexible interface and a highly detailed demographic data set.},

  abstract = {Geocomputation A Primer edited by Paul A Longley Sue M Brooks Rachael McDonnell School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol, UK and Bill Macmillan School of Geography, University of Oxford, UK This book encompasses all that is new in geocomputation. It is also a primer - that is, a book which sets out the foundations and scope of this important emergent area from the same contemporary perspective. The catalyst to the emergence of geocomputation is the new and creative application of computers to devise and depict digital representations of the Earth's surface. The environment for geocomputation is provided by geographical information systems (GIS), yet geocomputation is much more than GIS. Geocomputation is a blend of research-led applications which emphasise process over form, dynamics over statics, and interaction over passive response. This book presents a timely blend of current research and practice, written by the leading figures in the field. It provides insights to a new and rapidly developing area, and identifies the key foundations to future developments. It should be read by all who seek to use geocomputational methods for solving real world problems.},

  isbn = {0-691-14267-X},
  url = {http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8peKyWK_SWsC},
  abstract = {This is the first modern edition and first English translation of one of the earliest and most important works in the history of geography, the third-century Geographika of Eratosthenes. In this work, which for the first time described the geography of the entire inhabited world as it was then known, Eratosthenes of Kyrene (ca. 285-205 BC) invented the discipline of geography as we understand it. A polymath who served as librarian at Alexandria and tutor to the future King Ptolemy IV, Eratosthenes created the terminology of geography, probably including the word geographia itself. Building on his previous work, in which he determined the size and shape of the earth, Eratosthenes in the Geographika created a grid of parallels and meridians that linked together every place in the world: for the first time one could figure out the relationship and distance between remote localities, such as northwest Africa and the Caspian Sea. The Geographika also identified some four hundred places, more than ever before, from Thoule (probably Iceland) to Taprobane (Sri Lanka), and from well down the coast of Africa to Central Asia. This is the first collation of the more than 150 fragments of the Geographika in more than a century. Each fragment is accompanied by an English translation, a summary, and commentary. Duane W. Roller provides a rich background, including a history of the text and its reception, a biography of Eratosthenes, and a comprehensive account of ancient Greek geographical thought and of Eratosthenes' pioneering contribution to it. This edition also includes maps that show all of the known places named in the Geographika, appendixes, a bibliography, and indexes.},
