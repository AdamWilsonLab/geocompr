# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the **geocompr** website, the online home of our forthcoming book with [CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER).

Inspired by the **bookdown** [R package](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and book-hosting [website](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown), we are developing this book in the open. We encourage contributions.

**bookdown** makes editing a book as easy as editing a wiki.
To do so, just click on the 'edit me' icon highlighted in the image below.
Which-ever chapter you are looking at, this will take you to the source [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file hosted on GitHub. If you have a GitHub account, you'll be able to make changes there and submit a pull request. If you do not, it's time to [sign-up](https://github.com/)!

To raise an issue about the book's content (e.g. code not running) or make a feature request, check-out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues).

## Prerequisites {-}

To reproduce the book, first install it as a github package:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
if(!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/geocompr")
```

This should install all the necessary packages to run the code.
To build the book locally, clone or [download](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/archive/master.zip) the repo and run the following line from the [project](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/geocompr.Rproj)'s root directory:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")
```

For further details see the book's GitHub page at [Robinlovelace/geocompr](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr#geocomputation-with-r).
