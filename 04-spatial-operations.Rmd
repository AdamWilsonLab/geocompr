# Spatial data operations

## Prerequisites {-}

- This chapter requires **tidyverse**, **sf**, **units**, and **spData** packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(units)
```

- You must have loaded the `world` data from the spData package:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(spData)
data("world")
```

## Spatial subsetting

Spatial subsetting is the process of selecting only those features of a spatial object that in some way *intersect* with another spatial object.
Note that 'intersect' in this context has a precise meaning: any features in `x` that touch, overlap or are within features in `y` will be selected.
Intersect is the default operation for spatial subsetting but others can be used using the `op =`
argument.^[Interested
readers can see this default value of `op` set in the first line of the function call by entering its long-form name into the console: 
`` sf:::`[.sf` ``
]
Overall there are 9 well-defined operations that can be used for spatial subsetting, covered in section \@ref(topological-relations).
The great news is that you do not have to learn all of them separately:
after you understand how to spatially subset objects that *intersect* another (via `st_intersects()`) it is easy to subset based on other types of spatial operation such as `st_touches()`, `st_crosses()` and `st_within()`.
For this reason now we focus only one of the spatial subsetting operation.
We use `st_intersects()` instead of any of the others because not only because it the default when subsetting with the `[` operator:
`st_intersects()` 'catch all' that identifies all types of spatial relations.

In broad terms, spatial subsetting is equivalent of *attribute subsetting*, the process of creating a new object by selecting only rows whose attributes match certain criteria.
In section \@ref(attribute-subsetting) we saw how rows could be subsetted with the `[` operator by passing into it a vector of class `integer` (whole numbers) or `logical` (a vector of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s).
This means `world[1:6,]` subsets the first 6 countries of the world and that `world[world$area_km2 < 10000,]` returns the subset of countries that have a small surface area.

*Spatial* subsetting with the `[` operator follows the same pattern except you place *another spatial object* inside the square brackets.
To illustrate this concise and consistent syntax, let's create a hypothetical scenario: we want to select all countries in the world that lie within 5 degrees of the point where the equator (where latitude = 0 degrees) intersects the prime meridian (longitude = 0 degrees), as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:globe).
The input data for the subsetting layer is defined below (the data to be subset, or 'target layer', is the `world` object used in previous chapters):

```{r}
center = st_sf(st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 0))))
buff_equator = st_buffer(x = center, dist = 10)
```

```{r globe, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Hypothetical subsetting scenario: select all countries which intersect with a circle of 10 degrees in radius around planet Earth. Figure created with the **[globe](https://cran.r-project.org/package=globe)** package."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/globe.png")
```

### Distance relations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_distance(a, b)
```

### Spatial clipping

Spatial clipping is a form of spatial subsetting that involves changes to the `geometry` columns of at least some of the affected features.

Clipping can only apply to features more complex than points: 
lines, polygons and their 'multi' equivalents.
To illustrate the concept we will start with a simple example:
two overlapping circles with a centrepoint 1 unit away from each other and radius of 1:

```{r points, fig.cap="Overlapping circles."}
b = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 1)), st_point(c(1, 1))) # create 2 points
b = st_buffer(b, dist = 1) # convert points to circles
l = c("x", "y")
plot(b)
text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l) # add text
```

Imagine you want to select not one circle or the other, but the space covered by both `x` *and* `y`.
This can be done using the function `st_intersection()`, illustrated using objects named `x` and `y` which represent the left and right-hand circles:

```{r}
x = b[1]
y = b[2]
x_and_y = st_intersection(x, y)
plot(b)
plot(x_and_y, col = "lightgrey", add = TRUE) # color intersecting area
```

The subsequent code chunk demonstrate how this works for all combinations of the 'venn' diagram representing `x` and `y`, inspired by [Figure 5.1](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#logical-operators) of the book R for Data Science [@grolemund_r_2016].
<!-- Todo: reference r4ds -->

```{r venn-clip, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Spatial equivalents of logical operators"}
par(mfrow = c(3, 3), mai = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))
plot(b)
y_not_x = st_difference(y, x)
plot(y_not_x, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_difference(y, x)")
plot(b)
plot(x, add = TRUE, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "x")
plot(b, add = TRUE)
x_or_y = st_union(x, y)
plot(x_or_y, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_union(x, y)")
x_and_y = st_intersection(x, y)
plot(b)
plot(x_and_y, col = "grey", add = TRUE) 
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_intersection(x, y)")
# x_xor_y = st_difference(x_xor_y, x_and_y) # failing
x_not_y = st_difference(x, y)
x_xor_y = st_union(y_not_x, x_not_y)
plot(x_xor_y, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_union(y_not_x, x_not_y)")
plot.new()
plot(b)
plot(x_not_y, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_difference(x, y)")
plot(b)
plot(y, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
plot(b, add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "y")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

To illustrate the relationship between subsetting and clipping spatial data, we will subset points that cover the bounding box of the circles `x` and `y` in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-clip).
Some points will be inside just one circle, some will be inside both and some will be inside neither.
To generate the points will use a function not yet covered in this book, `st_sample()`.

There are two different ways to subset points that fit into combinations of the circles: via clipping and logical operators.
But first we must generate some points.
We will use the *simple random* sampling strategy to sample from a box representing the extent of `x` and `y`, using the code below to generate the situation plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-subset):

```{r venn-subset, fig.cap="Randomly distributed points within the bounding box enclosing circles x and y."}
bb = st_bbox(st_union(x, y))
pmat = matrix(c(bb[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2)]), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
box = st_polygon(list(pmat))
set.seed(2017)
p = st_sample(x = box, size = 10)
plot(box)
plot(x, add = T)
plot(y, add = T)
plot(p, add = T)
text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# An alternative way to sample from the bb
bb = st_bbox(st_union(x, y))
pmulti = st_multipoint(pmat)
box = st_convex_hull(pmulti)
```

### Exercises

Write code that subsets points that are contained within `x` *and* `y` (illustrated by the plot in the 2^nd^ row and the 1^st^ column in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-clip)).

- Create a randomly located point with the command `st_point()` (refer back to section \@ref(sfg) to see how to create spatial data 'from scratch').

scattered points with the command 

<!-- TODO? create a series of polygons distributed evenly over the surface of the Earth and clip them. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- set.seed(2018) -->
<!-- blob_points = st_sample(x = world, size = 2) -->
<!-- blobs = st_buffer(x = blob_points, dist = 1) -->
<!-- plot(blobs) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Spatial data aggregation 

<!-- - `aggregate.sf()` - aggregate an sf object, possibly union-ing geometries -->
<!-- - disaggregation?? `st_cast()` - https://github.com/edzer/sfr/wiki/migrating -->
<!-- - `group_by()` + `summarise()` - potential errors -->
<!-- - ? generalization **rmapsharper** - https://github.com/ateucher/rmapshaper -->
<!-- `st_union` -->

## Spatial data joining 

<!-- e.g. two point's datasets (non-overlapping) -->
<!-- e.g. two point's datasets (overlapping) -->
<!-- ? topological problems of joining lines/polygons? -->
<!-- joining different types (e.g. points + polygons = geometry) -> save as GPKG? -->
<!-- `merge()`; `st_interpolate_aw()` -->

## Spatial data creation

<!-- where should "area" example be? in this or the previous chapter? -->
<!-- `st_centroid()` -->
<!-- `st_buffer()` -->
<!-- http://r-spatial.org//r/2017/06/09/mapedit_0-2-0.html -->

```{r}
# add a new column
world$area = set_units(st_area(world), value = km^2)
world$pop_density = world$pop / world$area

# OR
world = world %>%
        mutate(area = set_units(st_area(.), value = km^2)) %>%
        mutate(pop_density = pop / area)
```

Note that this has created a attributes for the area and population density variables:

```{r}
attributes(world$area)
attributes(world$pop_density)
```

These can be set to `NULL` as follows:

```{r}
attributes(world$area) = NULL
attributes(world$pop_density) = NULL
```
