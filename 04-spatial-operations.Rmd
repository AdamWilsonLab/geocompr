## Introduction

Spatial operations are an important component of any geospatial software and vital for many applications involving spatial data.
There are clear overlaps between spatial and non-spatial operations.
Common spatial attribute data processing tasks include spatial subsetting (as we will see in section \@ref(spatial-subsetting)) aggregation (\@ref(spatial-aggregation)) and joining (covered in \@ref(spatial-joining)).
Each of these spatial operations has a non-spatial equivalent, as demonstrated in sections \@ref(attribute-subsetting), \@ref(attribute-data-aggregation) and \@ref(attribute-data-joining) respectively in Chapter \@ref(attr).

In addition to these basic spatial operations, the chapter will briefly demonstrate how new spatial data can be created 'from scratch' in section \@ref(spatial-data-creation), setting the scene for the subsequent chapter (\@ref(read-write)).
There are some topics that are specific to spatial data, however:

<!-- short description to the next sections -->
<!-- should be done after the first draft of the next sections -->
<!-- Note about that datasets should have the same projections -->

## Spatial subsetting

Spatial subsetting is the process of selecting only those features of a spatial object that in some way *intersect* with another spatial object.
Note that 'intersect' in this context has a precise meaning:
if `y` is used to subset features in a 'target' object of `x`, any features in `x` that touch, overlap or are within features in `y` will be selected.
Intersect is the default operation for spatial subsetting but others can be used using the `op =`
argument.^[Interested
readers can see this default value of `op` set in the first line of the function call by entering its long-form name into the console: 
`` sf:::`[.sf` ``
]

There are 9 well-defined operations that can be used for spatial subsetting, covered in section \@ref(topological-relations).
This may seem daunting but the good news is that you do not have to learn all of them separately:
after you understand how to spatially subset objects that *intersect* another (via `st_intersects()`) it is easy to subset based on other types of spatial operation such as `st_touches()`, `st_crosses()` and `st_within()`.
For this reason now we focus only pn one of the spatial subsetting operations.
We use `st_intersects()` instead of any of the others not only because it the default when subsetting with `[`,
but also `st_intersects()` is useful as a 'catch all' that identifies all types of spatial relations.

In general terms, spatial subsetting is simply the spatial equivalent of *attribute subsetting*.
However, to do spatial subsetting *two spatial objects are needed* the spatial relation between which is to be established.
As with attribute subsetting, spatial subsetting is a *binary operation*: an object is either selected or not.
As in section \@ref(attribute-subsetting), we start with base methods before describing how to do it in the **tidyverse**.
<!-- todo: link to non-binary links, e.g. area-weighted spatial interpolation -->

<!-- ### Spatial subsetting in base R -->

Attribute subsetting in base R is done with the `[` operator and passing into the square brackets a vector of class `integer` (whole numbers) or `logical` (a vector of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s).
This means `world[1:6,]` subsets the first 6 countries of the world and that `world[world$area_km2 < 10000,]` returns the subset of countries that have a small surface area.
For this chapter we will use countries in Africa, which can be generated using this method as
follows:^[Recall
that we can also subset simple features using the `filter()` function, e.g. with `filter(world, continent == "Africa")`]

```{r}
africa_wgs = world[world$subregion == "Western Africa", ]
```

To further set-up the input data, we will reproject the data to the coordinate reference system (CRS) 32630 (it's EPSG code, explained in Chapter 6):

```{r}
africa = st_transform(africa_wgs, crs = 32630) 
```

*Spatial* subsetting in base R use the same method as attribute subsetting, except *another spatial object* is placed inside the square brackets in the place of an `integer` or `logical` vector.
This is a concise and consistent syntax, as shown in the next code chunk.
Let's test it with a hypothetical scenario: we want to subset all countries within 20 degrees of the point where the equator (where latitude = 0 degrees) intersects the prime meridian (longitude = 0 degrees), as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:globe).
The subsetting object is created below.
Note that this must have the same CRS as the target object (set with the `crs` argument):

```{r, warning=FALSE}
center = st_sf(st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 0)), crs = 4326))
buff = st_buffer(x = center, dist = 20)
buff = st_transform(buff, 32630)
```

```{r globe, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Hypothetical subsetting scenario: select all countries which intersect with a circle of 20 degrees in radius around planet Earth. Figure created with the **[globe](https://cran.r-project.org/package=globe)** package."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/globe.png")
```

The data to be subset, or 'target layer', is the `africa` created above, which has a projected CRS (`32630`).
Now that the input data is set-up, the spatial subsetting operation is a single, concise command:

```{r}
africa_buff = africa[buff, ]
```

Note that the command emits a message: about assuming `planar coordinates`.
This is because spatial operations (especially distance and area calculations) cannot be assumed to be accurate in a geographic (longitude/latitude) CRS.
In this case there is a clear justification: the data is close to the equator where there is least distortion caused by the curvature of the earth, and the example illustrates the method, which would more usually be used on pojected ('planar') data.
In any case, the spatial subsetting clearly worked.
As illustrated by Figure \@ref(fig:buffeq), only countries which spatially intersect with the giant circle are returned:

```{r buffeq, fig.cap="Subset of the `africa` data selected based on their intersection with a circle 20 degrees in radius with a center point at 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude."}
# plot(africa_buff["pop"])
# plot(buff, add = TRUE)
```

Note that countries that only just touch the giant circle are selected such as the large country at the north of plot (Algeria).
`st_relates()` includes countries that only touch (but are not within or overlapping with) the selection object.
Other spatial subsetting operations such as `st_within()` are more conservative, as shown in section \@ref(topological-relations).

Before we progress to explore the differences between different spatial subsetting operations, it is worth seeing alternative ways to acheive the same result,
to deepen understanding of what is going on 'under the hood' (vital for developing advanced geocomputation applications).
The second way to reproduce the subsetting operation illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:buffeq) simply involves expanding the operation over 2 lines:

```{r}
sel_buff = st_intersects(x = africa, y = buff, sparse = FALSE)
africa_buff2 = africa[sel_buff, ]
```

The third way is essentially the same as the second, but uses the `filter()` function introduced in section \@ref(attribute-subsetting), forming the foundations of a 'tidy' spatial data analysis workflow.
If you already use **dplyr** for data manipulation, this way should seem familiar:

```{r}
africa_buff3 = africa %>%
  filter(st_intersects(x = ., y = buff, sparse = FALSE))
```

How can we be sure that the results obtained through the 4 subsetting operations demonstrated above?
We can test them as follows:

```{r}
identical(x = africa_buff, y = africa_buff2)
identical(x = africa_buff, y = africa_buff3)
```

The reason that the third spatially subset object (`africa_buff3`) is not identical is that **dplyr** changes the row names:

```{r}
head(row.names(africa_buff))
head(row.names(africa_buff3))
```

If the row names are re-set, the objects become identical:

```{r}
attr(africa_buff3, "row.names") = attr(x = africa_buff, "row.names")
identical(africa_buff, africa_buff3)
```


### Note {-}

This discarding of row names is not something that is specific to spatial
data:^[**dplyr** discards row names by design.
For further discussion of this decision, and some controversy, see the (closed) issue [#366](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/366) in the package's issue tracker.]

```{r}
row.names(africa[africa$subregion == "Northern Europe",])
row.names(filter(africa, subregion == "Northern Europe"))
```

## Spatial aggregation 

Like attribute data aggregation, covered in section \@ref(attribute-data-aggregation), spatial data aggregation is a way of *condensing* data.
Aggregated data show some statistic about a variable (typically mean average or total) in relation to some kind of *grouping variable*. 
For attribute data aggregation the grouping variable is another variable, typically one with few unique values relative to the number of rows.
The `continent` variable in the `world` dataset is a good example:
there are only 8 unique continents but 177 countries.
In section \@ref(attribute-data-aggregation) the aggregation process condensed the `world` dataset down into only 8 rows and an aggregated `pop` variable representing the total population per continent (see Figure \@ref(fig:continent-pop)).

Spatial data aggregation is the same conceptually but uses a *spatial* grouping object:
the *output* is the same, in terms of number of rows/features and geometry, as the *grouping object*, but with new variables corresponding to the input dataset.
As with spatial subsetting, spatial aggregation operations work by extending existing functions.
Since mid-2017 (with the release of **sf** `0.5-3`) the base R function `aggregate()` works with a spatial object as a grouping variable.

Building on the example presented the previous section (\@ref(spatial-subsetting)), we demonstrate this by aggregating the population of countries that intersect with the buffer represented by the circular `buff` object created in the previous section.

```{r}
buff_agg = aggregate(x = africa["pop"], by = buff, FUN = sum)
```

The result, `buff_agg`, is a spatial object with the same geometry as `by` (the circular buffer in this case) but with an additional variable, `pop` reporting summary statistics for all features in `x` that intersect with `by` (the total population of the countries that touch the buffer in this case).
Plotting the result (with `plot(buff_agg)`) shows that the operation does not really make sense:
Figure \@ref(fig:buff-agg) shows a population of over half a billion people mostly located in a giant circle floating off the west coast of Africa!  

```{r buff-agg, fig.cap="Result of spatial aggregation showing the total population of countries that intersect with a large circle whose center lies at 0 degrees longitude and latituge", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
pal = tmaptools::get_brewer_pal(palette = "BuPu", n = 4, plot = F)
breaks = c(0, 1e7, 1e8, 5e8, 1e9)
bb_buff = tmaptools::bb(buff_agg, ext = 1.5)
qtm(buff_agg, fill = pal[4], bbox = bb_buff)
# +
#   tm_shape(africa_buff) +
#   tm_fill("pop", palette = pal, breaks = breaks) +
#   tm_borders() #+
  # qtm(africa[st_disjoint(africa, buff, sparse = FALSE),]) +
  # tm_shape(buff) +
  # tm_borders(lwd = 3, lty = 3) 
detach("package:tmap", unload = TRUE)
```

The results of the spatial aggregation exercise presented in Figure \@ref(fig:buff-agg) are unrealistic for three reasons:

- People do not live in the sea (the geometry of the aggregating object is not appropriate for the geometry target object).
- This method would 'double count' countries whose borders cross aggregating polygons when multiple, spatially contiguous, features are used as the aggregating object.
- It is wrong to assume that all the people living in countries that *touch* the buffer reside *within* it (the default spatial operator `st_intersects()` is too 'greedy'). The most extreme example of this is Algeria, the most northerly country selected:
the spatial aggregation operation assumes that all 39 million Algerian citizens reside in the tiny southerly tip that is within the circular buffer.

A number of methods can be used to overcome these issues, which result in unrealistically high population attributed to the circular buffer illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:buff-agg).
The simplest of these is to convert the country polygons into points representing their *geographic centroids* before aggregation.
<!-- Todo: reference section where we demonstrate geographic centroid generation -->
This would ensure that any spatially contiguous aggregating object covering the target object (the Earth in this case) would result in the same total: there would be no double counting.
The estimated total population residing within the study area would be more realistic if geographic centroids were used.
(The centroid of Algeria, for example, is far outside the aggregating buffer.)
Except in cases where the number of target features per aggregating feature is very large, or where the aggregating object is *spatially congruent* with the target (covered in section \@ref(spatial-congruence-and-areal-interpolation)), using centroids can also lead to errors due to boundary effects:
imagine a buffer that covers a large area but contains no centroids.
These issues can be tackled when aggregating areal target data with areal interpolation.

### Spatial congruence and areal interpolation

Spatial congruence is an important concept related to spatial aggregation.
An *aggregating object* object (which we will refer to as `y`, representing the buffer object in the previous section) is *congruent* with the target object (`x`, representing the countries in the previous section) if the two objects have shared borders.

*Incongruent* aggregating objects, by contrast, do not share common borders with the target [@qiu_development_2012].
This is problematic for spatial aggregation (and other spatial operations) illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:areal-example).
Areal interpolation resolves this issue.
A number of algorithms have been developed for areal interpolation, including area weighted and pycnophylactic interpolation methods task [@tobler_smooth_1979].

```{r areal-example, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of congruent (left) and incongruent (right) areal units.", warning=FALSE}
rx = st_as_sf(raster::rasterToPolygons(raster::raster(ncol = 4, nrow = 4)))
ry = st_as_sf(raster::rasterToPolygons(raster::raster(ncol = 2, nrow = 2)))
rxo = st_as_sf(st_set_geometry(rx, NULL), geometry = rx$geometry + 15)
st_crs(rx) = NA
rx = rbind(rx, rxo)
set.seed(1985)
rx$value = rep(runif(nrow(rx) / 2), 2)
rx$layer = rep(c("Congruent", "Incongruent"), each = nrow(rxo))
library(tmap)
qtm(rx, "value") + tm_facets(by = "layer", drop.units = T, ncol = 2) +
    tm_shape(ry) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 10) +
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE)
detach("package:tmap", unload = TRUE)
```

The simplest useful method for spatial interpolation is *area weighted* spatial interpolation.
This is implemented in `st_interpolate_aw()`, as demonstrated below:

```{r}
buff_agg_aw = st_interpolate_aw(x = africa["pop"], to = buff, extensive = TRUE)
```

<!-- - `aggregate.sf()` - aggregate an sf object, possibly union-ing geometries -->
<!-- - disaggregation?? `st_cast()` - https://github.com/edzer/sfr/wiki/migrating -->
<!-- - `group_by()` + `summarise()` - potential errors -->
<!-- - ? generalization **rmapsharper** - https://github.com/ateucher/rmapshaper -->

## Spatial joining 

<!-- e.g. two point's datasets (non-overlapping) -->
<!-- e.g. two point's datasets (overlapping) -->
<!-- ? topological problems of joining lines/polygons? -->
<!-- joining different types (e.g. points + polygons = geometry) -> save as GPKG? -->
<!-- `merge()`; `st_interpolate_aw()` -->

## Spatial data creation

<!-- where should "area" example be? in this or the previous chapter? -->
<!-- `st_centroid()` -->
<!-- `st_buffer()` -->
<!-- http://r-spatial.org//r/2017/06/09/mapedit_0-2-0.html -->

```{r}
# add a new column
africa$area = set_units(st_area(africa), value = km^2)
africa$pop_density = africa$pop / africa$area

# OR
africa = africa %>%
        mutate(area = set_units(st_area(.), value = km^2)) %>%
        mutate(pop_density = pop / area)
```

Note that this has created a attributes for the area and population density variables:

```{r}
attributes(africa$area)
attributes(africa$pop_density)
```

These can be set to `NULL` as follows:

```{r}
attributes(africa$area) = NULL
attributes(africa$pop_density) = NULL
```

## Spatial clipping

Spatial clipping is a form of spatial subsetting that involves changes to the `geometry` columns of at least some of the affected features.

Clipping can only apply to features more complex than points: 
lines, polygons and their 'multi' equivalents.
To illustrate the concept we will start with a simple example:
two overlapping circles with a centrepoint 1 unit away from each other and radius of 1:

```{r points, fig.cap="Overlapping circles."}
b = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 1)), st_point(c(1, 1))) # create 2 points
b = st_buffer(b, dist = 1) # convert points to circles
l = c("x", "y")
plot(b)
text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l) # add text
```

Imagine you want to select not one circle or the other, but the space covered by both `x` *and* `y`.
This can be done using the function `st_intersection()`, illustrated using objects named `x` and `y` which represent the left and right-hand circles:

```{r}
x = b[1]
y = b[2]
x_and_y = st_intersection(x, y)
plot(b)
plot(x_and_y, col = "lightgrey", add = TRUE) # color intersecting area
```

The subsequent code chunk demonstrate how this works for all combinations of the 'venn' diagram representing `x` and `y`, inspired by [Figure 5.1](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#logical-operators) of the book R for Data Science [@grolemund_r_2016].
<!-- Todo: reference r4ds -->

```{r venn-clip, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Spatial equivalents of logical operators"}
par(mfrow = c(3, 3), mai = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))
plot(b)
y_not_x = st_difference(y, x)
plot(y_not_x, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_difference(y, x)")
plot(b)
plot(x, add = TRUE, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "x")
plot(b, add = TRUE)
x_or_y = st_union(x, y)
plot(x_or_y, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_union(x, y)")
x_and_y = st_intersection(x, y)
plot(b)
plot(x_and_y, col = "grey", add = TRUE) 
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_intersection(x, y)")
# x_xor_y = st_difference(x_xor_y, x_and_y) # failing
x_not_y = st_difference(x, y)
x_xor_y = st_union(y_not_x, x_not_y)
plot(x_xor_y, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_union(y_not_x, x_not_y)")
plot.new()
plot(b)
plot(x_not_y, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_difference(x, y)")
plot(b)
plot(y, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
plot(b, add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "y")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

To illustrate the relationship between subsetting and clipping spatial data, we will subset points that cover the bounding box of the circles `x` and `y` in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-clip).
Some points will be inside just one circle, some will be inside both and some will be inside neither.
To generate the points will use a function not yet covered in this book, `st_sample()`.

There are two different ways to subset points that fit into combinations of the circles: via clipping and logical operators.
But first we must generate some points.
We will use the *simple random* sampling strategy to sample from a box representing the extent of `x` and `y`, using the code below to generate the situation plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-subset):

```{r venn-subset, fig.cap="Randomly distributed points within the bounding box enclosing circles x and y."}
bb = st_bbox(st_union(x, y))
pmat = matrix(c(bb[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2)]), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
box = st_polygon(list(pmat))
set.seed(2017)
p = st_sample(x = box, size = 10)
plot(box)
plot(x, add = T)
plot(y, add = T)
plot(p, add = T)
text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# An alternative way to sample from the bb
bb = st_bbox(st_union(x, y))
pmulti = st_multipoint(pmat)
box = st_convex_hull(pmulti)
```

### Exercises

1. Write code that subsets points that are contained within `x` *and* `y` (illustrated by the plot in the 2^nd^ row and the 1^st^ column in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-clip)).
- Create a randomly located point with the command `st_point()` (refer back to section \@ref(sfg) to see how to create spatial data 'from scratch').
2. Write code that uses functions `aggregate()` and `st_buffer()` to answers the following question: What proportion of the world's population lives in countries that intersect a circle with a 10 degree radius of the intersection between the equator and the [9^th^ meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_meridian_east)? (Advanced challenge: find the point with the highest number of people within a 10 degree radius.)

```{r}
center9 = st_sf(st_sfc(st_point(c(-9, 0)), crs = 4326))
buff9 = st_buffer(center9, dist = 10)
agg9 = aggregate(world["pop"], buff9, FUN = sum)
agg9$pop / sum(world$pop, na.rm = TRUE)
```

3. Assuming that people are evenly distributed across countries, estimate the population living *within* the circle created to answer the previous question.

```{r}
interp9 = st_interpolate_aw(x = world["pop"], to = buff9, extensive = TRUE)

```

<!-- TODO? create a series of polygons distributed evenly over the surface of the Earth and clip them. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- set.seed(2018) -->
<!-- blob_points = st_sample(x = world, size = 2) -->
<!-- blobs = st_buffer(x = blob_points, dist = 1) -->
<!-- plot(blobs) -->
<!-- ``` -->
