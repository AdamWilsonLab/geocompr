- How best to represent the sf class system so students benefit most from the diagram in section 2.1? See discussion in this commit for at least 3 options of the best way forward: https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/commit/46f50e4c556c2252e372b69b2df1ad9eff09c709
- Should we keep all the Exercises at the end of the chapters for consistency, or add additional Exercises before the end? (Latest thinking: have a main Excercises section at the end of each chapter but include some exercises mid-chapter where appropriate.)
- How should we handle units? At present we describe them briefly in the context of simple features in Section [2.4](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/spatial-class.html#units) and then again in exercises [3.7](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/attr.html#exercises-2) but we were wondering if a more systematic coverage of this potentially tricky topic is needed
- Likewise for CRSs - we introduce them in [2.3](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/spatial-class.html#crs-intro) but plan a larger section, going into more detail about how to select and modify them, in Chapter 6. Sound good?
- At present we have tried to keep vector and raster data relatively well-integrated. However, there has been discussion of splitting-out some of the raster stuff (see [github discussion](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/pull/80#discussion_r135806844)) in the context of matrix algebra, which blurs the boundary between spatial and non-spatial operations. Any thoughts on this, with a view to ease of understanding, welcome.
