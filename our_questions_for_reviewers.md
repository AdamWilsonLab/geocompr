- How best to represent the sf class system so students benefit most from the diagram in section 2.1? See discussion in this commit for at least 3 options of the best way forward: https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/commit/46f50e4c556c2252e372b69b2df1ad9eff09c709
- Should we keep all the Exercises at the end of the chapters for consistency, or add additional Exercises before the end? (Latest thinking: have a main Excercises section at the end of each chapter but include some exercises mid-chapter where appropriate.)
- How should we handle units? At present we describe them briefly in the context of simple features in Section [2.4](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/spatial-class.html#units) and then again in exercises [3.7](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/attr.html#exercises-2) but we were wondering if a more systematic coverage of this potentially tricky topic is needed
