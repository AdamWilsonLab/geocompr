## An introduction to Simple Features {#intro-sf}

Simple Features is an open standard data model developed and endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium ([OGC](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355)) to describe how features with geographical and non-geographical features should be represented.
It is a hierarchical data model that simplifies geographic data by condensing the complex range of possible geographic forms (e.g., line, point, polygon, multipolygon forms) into a single geometry class.

<!-- (Figure \@ref(fig:sf-ogc)). -->

<!-- ```{r sf-ogc, fig.cap="The Simple Features class hierarchy, used with permission (on condition of linking to the source) from the Open Geospatial Consortium's document 06-103r4 (see http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa)", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("figures/simple-feature-class-hierarchy.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

The R implementation of Simple Features is provided by the **sf** package [@R-sf], which can be installed with the following command:^[The
development version, which may contain new features, can be installed with `devtools::install_github("edzer/sfr")`
]

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

**sf** incorporates the functionality of the 3 main packages of the **sp** paradigm (**sp** [@R-sp] for the class system, **rgdal** [@R-rgdal] for reading and writing data, **rgeos** [@R-rgeos] for spatial operations undertaken by GEOS) in a single, cohesive whole.
This is well-documented in **sf**'s [vignettes](http://cran.rstudio.com/package=sf):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("sf1") # for an introduction to the package
vignette("sf2") # for reading, writing and converting Simple Features
vignette("sf3") # for manipulating Simple Features
```

As the first vignette explains, simple feature objects in R are stored in a data frame, with geographic data occupying special column, a 'list-column'. This column is usually named 'geom' or 'geometry'.
A 'real world' example is loaded by the **spData** package, which loads the `world` object:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(spData)
data("world")
```

In the above code **spData** silently loaded the `world` dataset (and many other spatial datasets - see [nowosad/spData](https://github.com/Nowosad/spData) for a full list).
The dataset contains spatial and non-spatial information, as shown by the function `names()`, which reports the column headings in data frames. 
This can be seen as the final column name of `world`:

```{r}
names(world)
```

It is the contents of this modest-looking `geom` column that gives `sf` objects their spatial powers.
It's actually a list-column, containing all the coordinates needed to plot the result as a map using the `plot()` method, the results of which are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:world-all).

```{r world-all, fig.cap="A spatial plot of the world using the sf package, with a facet for each attribute."}
library(sf) # must be loaded to plot sf objects
plot(world)
```

Note that instead of creating a single map, as most GIS programs would, the `plot()` command has created multiple maps, one for each variable in the `world` datasets.
This behavior can be useful for exploring the spatial distribution of different variables and is discussed further in @\ref(basic-map) below.

Being able to treat spatial objects as regular data frames with spatial powers has many advantages, especially if you are already used to working with data frames.
The commonly used `summary()` function, for example, provides a useful overview of the variables within the `world` object, but prefixed with some information about the object's spatial component:

```{r}
summary(world["lifeExp"])
```

The result provides a quick summary of both the non-spatial and spatial data contained in `world`.
The former tells us that average life expectancy for humans on planet Earth is around around 70 years (ranging from less than 50 to more than 80 years).
The latter tells us that the spatial component of `world` comprises a `MULTIPOLYGON` with 177 features and a geographical (lat/lon) coordinate reference system (CRS) with an EPSG code of `4326`.

<!-- TODO: cross-reference section covering CRSs. -->

Note that by appending `["lifeExp"]` onto the object name in the previous code chunk, only the relevant column was summarised.
We explore such 'attribute operations' in Chapter \@ref(attr).
First, it's worth taking a look at the basic behavior and contents of this simple feature object, which can usefully be thought of as a '**S**patial data**F**rame).

`sf` objects are easy to subset.
The code below shows its first 2 rows and 3 columns.
The output shows 2 major differences compared with a regular `data.frame`: the inclusion of additional geographic data (`geometry type`, `dimension`, `bbox` and CRS information - `epsg (SRID)`, `proj4string`), and the presence of final `geometry` column:

```{r}
world[1:2, 1:3]
```

All this may seem rather complex, especially for a class system that is supposed to be simple.
However, there are good reasons for organizing things this way and using **sf**.

### Exercises

What does the summary of the `geometry` column tell us about the `world` dataset, in terms of:

- The geometry type?
- How many countries there are?
- The coordinate reference system (CRS)?

## Why Simple Features?

There are many advantages of **sf** over **sp**, including:

- Faster reading and writing of data (more than 10 times faster in some cases)
- Better plotting performance
- **sf** objects can be treated as dataframes in most operations
- **sf** functions can be combined using `%>%` operator and works well with the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) collection of R packages
- **sf** function names are relatively consistent and intuitive (all begin with `st_`) compared with the function names and syntax of the **sp**, **rgdal** and **rgeos** packages that it supersedes.

A broader advantage is that simple features are so well supported by other software products, not least PostGIS, which has heavily influenced the design of **sf**.

A disadvantage you should be aware of, however, is that **sf** is not *feature complete* and that it continues to evolve.
The transition from **sp** to **sf** will likely take many years, and many spatial packages may never switch.
Even if you discover spatial data with R through the **sf** package, it is still worth at least being aware of **sp** classes, even if you rarely use them for everyday geospatial tasks.

Fortunately it is easy to translate between **sp** and **sf** using the `as()` function: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sp)
world_sp = as(object = world, Class = "Spatial")
```

## Basic map making {#basic-map}

Basic maps in **sf** can be created quickly with the base `plot()` function. Unlike **sp**, however, **sf** by default creates a faceted plot, one sub-plot for each variable, as illustrated in the left-hand image in Figure \@ref(fig:sfplot). 

```{r sfplot, fig.cap="Plotting with sf, with multiple variables (left) and a single variable (right).", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', warning=FALSE}
plot(world[3:4])
plot(world["pop"])
```

As with **sp**, you can add layers to your maps created with `plot()`, with the argument `add = TRUE`.^[In
fact, when you `plot()` an **sf** object, R is calling `sf:::plot.sf()` behind the scenes.
`plot()` is a generic method that behaves differently depending on the class of object being plotted.]
To illustrate this, and prepare for content covered in chapters \@ref(attr) and \@ref(spatial-data-operations) on attribute and spatial data operations, we will subset and combine countries in the `world` object, to create a single object that represents Asia:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
asia = world[world$continent == "Asia",]
asia = st_union(asia)
```

We can now plot the Asian continent over a map of the world.
Note, however, that this only works if the initial plot has only 1 layer:

```{r asia, out.width='50%'}
plot(world["pop"])
plot(asia, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

This can be very useful for quickly checking the geographic correspondence between two or more layers: 
the `plot()` function is fast to execute and requires few lines of code, but does not create interactive maps with a wide range of options.
For more advanced map making we recommend using a dedicated visualisation package such as **tmap**, **ggplot2**, **mapview**, or **leaflet**.

<!-- Maybe show also somewhere that `world[0]` produces only a plot of the geometry which is rather useful if you do not want to plot a specific attribute. This way, you can for example dismiss the col = "white"-argument in your Nigeria example. -->

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
plot(africa[0], lwd = 3, main = "Nigeria in context", border = "lightgrey")
```

### Challenge

Using **sf**'s `plot()` command, create a map of Nigeria in context, building on the code that creates and plots Asia above (see Figure \@ref(fig:nigeria) for an example of what this could look like). 

- Hint: this used the `lwd`, `main` and `col` arguments of `plot()`. 
- Bonus: make the country boundaries a dotted grey line.
- Hint: `border` is an additional argument of `plot()` for **sf** objects.

```{r nigeria, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of Nigeria in context illustrating sf's plotting capabilities"}

nigeria = world[world$name_long == "Nigeria",]
africa = world[world$continent == "Africa",]
bb_africa = st_bbox(africa)
plot(africa[2], col = "white", lwd = 3, main = "Nigeria in context", border = "lightgrey")
# plot(world, lty = 3, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(world, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(nigeria, col = "yellow", add = TRUE, border = "darkgrey")
ncentre = st_centroid(nigeria)
ncentre_num = st_coordinates(ncentre)
text(x = ncentre_num[1], y = ncentre_num[2], labels = "Nigeria")
```

### Further work

**sf** makes R data objects more closely aligned to the data model used in GDAL and GEOS, in theory making spatial data operations faster.
The work here provides a taste of the way **sf** operates but there is much more to learn (see Chapter \@ref(spatial-data-operations)). And there is also a wealth of information in the highly recommended vignettes of the package.

As a final exercise, we'll see one way of how to do a spatial overlay in **sf**. First, we convert the countries of the world into centroids, and then subset those in Asia. Finally, the `summary`-command tells us how many centroids (countries) are part of Asia (43) and how many are not (134).

```{r}
world_centroids = st_centroid(world)
sel_asia = st_intersects(world_centroids, asia, sparse = FALSE)
summary(sel_asia)
```

Note: another way of achieving the same result is with a GEOS function for identifying spatial overlay, which we'll cover in more datail in Chapter \@ref(spatial-data-operations).

Because **sf**'s `plot()` builds on the base `plot()` function, you have access to all the base plotting options developed for base plotting.
If you are accustomed to base plotting, this will be useful, as illustrated by the variable circle sizes generated by the `cex` argument in Figure \@ref(fig:africa), which was generated using the code below.

```{r africa, fig.cap="Centroids representing country population, diameter being proportional to population.", warning=FALSE}

plot(world["continent"])
plot(world_centroids, add = TRUE, cex = world$pop / 1e8, lwd = 3)
```

<!-- More appropriate for subsequent chapters. -->
<!-- This shows that there are 43 countries in Asia -->
<!-- We can check if they are the same countries as follows: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- africa_centroids2 = world_centroids[sel_africa,] -->
<!-- identical(africa_centroids, africa_centroids2) -->
<!-- ``` -->

### Exercises

- What does the `lwd` argument do in the `plot()` code that generates Figure \@ref(fig:africa). 
- Perform the same operations and map making for another continent of your choice.
- Bonus: Download some global geographic data and add attribute variables assigning them to the continents of the world.

## Simple feature geometries, collections and data frames {#sfg}

To understand new data formats in depth, it often helps to generate them for first principles.
This section walks through vector spatial classes step-by-step, from the simplest simple feature geometry to simple feature objects, with class `sf`, representing complex spatial data.
Before describing each geometry type that the **sf** package supports it is worth taking a step back to understand the building blocks of `sf` objects. 
As stated in section \@ref(intro-sf), simple features are simply dataframes with at least one special column that makes it spatial.
These spatial columns are often called `geom` or `geometry` and can be like non-spatial columns: `world$geom` refers to the spatial element of the `world` object described above.
These geometry columns are 'list columns' of class `sfc`: they are *simple feature collections*.
In turn, `sfc` objects are composed of one or more objects of class `sfg`: simple feature geometries.

To understand how the spatial components of simple features work, it is vital to understand simple feature geometries.
For this reason we cover each type currently supported `sfg` in the next section before moving to describe how they can be combined to form `sfc` and eventually full `sf` objects.

## Geometries

This section demonstrates how the full range of geometry types supported by the **sf** package can be created, combined and plotted.
Geometries are the basic building blocks of simple features.
Simple features could be represented as one of the 17 geometry types using the **sf** package.
In this chapter we will focus on seven, the most commonly used, simple features types: `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `POLYGON`, `MULTIPOINT`, `MULTILINESTRING`, `MULTIPOLYGON` and `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`.<!--FIG-->
The whole list of possible feature types could be found in [the PostGIS manual ](http://postgis.net/docs/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html).

Simple features could be represented in one of two ways, ether as a well-known binary (WKB) or well-known text (WKT). 
Well-known binary (WKB) representations are usually hexadecimal strings, which are used to transfer and store geometry objects in databases.
Well-known text (WKT), on the other hand, is a text markup description of simple features. 
Both formats are exchangeable, therefore we would focus only on the well-known text (WKT) representation.

All of the geometry types are built of points. 
Each point could be described as coordinates in a 2D, 3D or 4D space:

- X and Y coordinates represent location of points. It could be either easting and northing or longitude and latitude.
- A Z coordinate denotes altitude.
- An M coordinate ("measure") allows to represent some measure associated to the point, but not the whole feature. 
This coordinate could be a time of measurement, information who measured this point or what's the error of measurement.

As a result, four possible types of points exist - XY (two-dimensional), XYZ (three-dimensional containing altitude), XYM (three-dimensional containing measure) and XYZM (four-dimensional).
They could be easily describes as well-known text:

- XY - `POINT (5 2)`
- XYZ - `POINT (5 2 3)`
- XYM - `POINTM (5 2 1)`
- XYZM - `POINT (5 2 3 1)`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(st_as_sfc(c("POINT(5 2)")), axes = TRUE)
```

The rest of the geometries have similar form.
A linestring is represented by a sequence of points with linear interpolation between points, for example:

- `LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(st_as_sfc("LINESTRING(1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)"), axes = TRUE)
```

Linestring cannot have self intersecting line part.
In other words, lines shouldn't pass through the same point twice (except for the endpoint).

A polygon is a sequence of points, where the first and last point have the same coordinates. 
Similarly to linestring, polygon needs to create a non-self intersecting ring.
By the definition, polygon has one exterior boundary and zero or more interior boundaries.
These interior boundaries are often known as holes.

- Zero interior boundaries (holes) - `POLYGON ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 1 5))`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(st_as_sfc("POLYGON((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 1 5))"), axes = TRUE)
```

- One hole - `POLYGON ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3))`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(st_as_sfc("POLYGON((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3))"), axes = TRUE)
```
