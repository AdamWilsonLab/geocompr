## An introduction to Simple Features

Simple Features is an open standard data model developed and endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium ([OGC](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355)) to describe how features with geographical and non-geographical features should be represented.
It is a hierarchical data model that simplifies geographic data by condensing the complex range of possible geographic forms (e.g., line, point, polygon, multipolygon forms) into a single geometry class.

The R implementation of Simple Features is provided by the **sf** package [@R-sf].
**sf** incorporates the functionality of the 3 main packages of the **sp** paradigm (**sp** [@R-sp] for the class system, **rgdal** [@R-rgdal] for reading and writing data, **rgeos** [@R-rgeos] for spatial operations undertaken by GEOS) in a single, cohesive whole.
This is well-documented in **sf**'s [vignettes](http://cran.rstudio.com/package=sf):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("sf1") # for an introduction to the package
vignette("sf2") # for reading, writing and converting Simple Features
vignette("sf3") # for manipulating Simple Features
```

As the first vignette explains, simple feature objects in R are stored in a data frame, with geographical data occupying special column, a 'list-column'. This column is usually named 'geom' or 'geometry'.
Let's see how simple feature in R work, with reference to world boundary data from the **spData** package:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(sf)
# devtools::install_github("nowosad/spData")
f = system.file("shapes/wrld.shp", package = "spData")
world = st_read(f)
```

This has loaded an object that is simultaneously of class `data.frame` and `sf`:

```{r}
class(world)
```

The output of the preceding command shows that objects with class `sf` are also data frames. Thus, they can be treated like regular `data.frame`, making life easy if you are already used to working with data frames.

Let's look the first 2 rows and 3 columns of this object.
The output shows 2 major differences compared with a regular `data.frame`: the inclusion of additional geographical data (`geometry type`, `dimension`, `bbox` and CRS information - `epsg (SRID)`, `proj4string`), and the presence of final `geometry` column:

```{r}
world[1:2, 1:3]
```

All this may seem rather complex, especially for a class system that is supposed to be simple.
However, there are good reasons for organizing things this way and using **sf**.

### Exercises

What does the summary of the `geometry` column tell us about the `world` dataset, in terms of:

- The geometry type?
- How many countries there are?
- The coordinate reference system (CRS)?

## Why Simple Features?

There are many advantages of **sf** over **sp**, including:

- Faster reading and writing of data (more than 10 times faster in some cases)
- Better plotting performance
- **sf** objects can be treated as dataframes in most operations
- **sf** functions can be combined using `%>%` operator and works well with the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) collection of R packages
- **sf** function names are relatively consistent and intuitive (all begin with `st_`) compared with the function names and syntax of the **sp**, **rgdal** and **rgeos** packages that it supersedes.

A broader advantage is that simple features are so well supported by other software products, not least PostGIS, which has heavily influenced the design of **sf**.

A disadvantage you should be aware of, however, is that **sf** is not *feature complete* and that it continues to evolve.
The transition from **sp** to **sf** will likely take many years, and many spatial packages may never switch.
Even if you discover spatial data with R through the **sf** package, it is still worth at least being aware of **sp** classes, even if you rarely use them for everyday geospatial tasks.

Fortunately it is easy to translate between **sp** and **sf** using the `as()` function, even when **sp** is not loaded: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world_sp = as(object = world, Class = "Spatial")
```
