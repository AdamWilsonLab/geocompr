# Geographic data in R {#spatial-class}

## Prerequisites {-}

This is the first practical chapter of book and therefore has software requirements.
We assume you have a recent version of R installed on your computer and are comfortable using it at the command line, e.g. via an integrated development environment (IDE) such as RStudio (recommended).
R/RStudio works on all major operating systems and can be installed and set-up in a few minutes on most modern computers, as described in [section 2.3](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#r-version) and [section 2.5](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#rstudio) of @gillespie_efficient_2016 (other guides are available).

If you are not a regular R user is worth taking time to ensure that you have an efficient R workflow because this will make the subsequent worked examples easier to run on your own computer, e.g. as part of an RStudio '[project](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#project-management)' such as that provided in the root directory of the [`geocompr`](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr) GitHub repository.
We recommend getting up-to-speed with the language, with reference to resources such as @gillespie_efficient_2016, @grolemund_r_2016, and online interactive guides such as that provided by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r), before proceeding with the chapter.

* * *

After R is installed and set-up, packages which extend R must be installed and loaded for it to handle spatial data.
On Mac and Linux operating systems there are a few additional requirements: see the [README](https://github.com/edzer/sfr) of the **sf** package for instructions.
The **sf** and **spData** packages used in this chapter can be installed and loaded with the following commands (which requires **devtools**):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nowosad/spData")
library(sf)
library(spData)
```

This chapter will provide brief explanations of both the fundamental geographic data types: vector and raster.
A brief abstract description is provided of each before moving quickly to their implementation in R packages designed specifically for handling them.
Both are vital to the sciences, although which will be of most use will largely depend on your discipline:

- Because human settlements and boundaries tend to be complex with precise borders defined by legal systems, vector data tends to dominate in the social sciences.
- In environmental sciences, by contrast, raster data tend to dominate due to its links to remote sensing.

However, there is a substantial level of overlap:
ecologists and demographers, for example, commonly use both vector and raster geographical data types.
We therefore strongly recommend learning about each type of data before proceeding to understand how to manipulate them in subsequent chapters.

## Vector data

Vector data are based on points that are located on a Cartesian (or geographic) coordinate system.
Each point in vector data is typically described by two numbers representing distance from the $origin$ along the $x$ (horizontal) and $y$ (vertical) axis in Euclidean space.^[In 3 dimensional coordinate systems three numbers are needed for each of the three axes, $x$, $y$ and $z$.]
In mathematical notation these points are typically represented as numbers separated by commas and enclosed by a pair of brackets: 
$(1, 3)$ for example, represents a point located one unit to the right and three units above the origin.
There is clear link between these vector points and the `vector` class in R.
The following line of code, for example, creates a 2 dimensional vector:

```{r}
p = vector(mode = "numeric", length = 2)
```

More commonly one would use the command `c()` (think of 'c' for 'combine') or `seq()` (short for 'sequence') to create vectors, as illustrated below in which the point illustrated in mathematical notation is created:

```{r}
p = c(1, 3)
```

Now this can be plotted in Cartesian space:

```{r}
plot(p[1], p[2], xlim =  c(0, 5), ylim = c(0, 5))
```

Generally vector points have a high level of precision (but not necessarily accuracy) in geographic space as opposed to raster data which relies on cells that break the surface up into a discrete number of cells of the same size.
This book uses simple features to work with vector data.

### An introduction to Simple Features {#intro-sf}

Simple features is an open standard data model developed and endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium ([OGC](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355)) to represent a wide range of geographical information in a consistent data schema.
Simple features is a hierarchical data model that simplifies geographic data by condensing a complex range of geographic forms into a single geometry class.
Only 7 out of 68 possible types of simple feature are currently used in the vast majority of GIS operations (Figure \@ref(fig:sf-ogc)).
All of these are fully supported (with plotting methods etc) in the R package **sf** [@R-sf].^[
The full OGC standard includes rather exotic geometry types including 'surface' and 'curve' geometry types, which currently have limited application in real world applications.
All 68 types can be represented in R, although (at the time of writing) all methods, such as plotting, are only supported for the 7 types that are used.
]


```{r sf-ogc, fig.cap="The subset of the Simple Features class hierarchy supported by sf. Figure based on the Open Geospatial Consortium document [06-103r4](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa).", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/sf-classes.png")
```

**sf** can represent all common vector geometry types (raster data classes are not supported by **sf**): points, lines, polygons and their respective 'multi' versions (which group together features of the same type into a single feature).
**sf** also supports geometry collections, which can contain multiple geometry types in a single feature.
Given the breadth of geographic data forms, it may come as a surprise that a class system to support all of them is provided in a single package, which can be installed from CRAN:^[The
development version, which may contain new features, can be installed with `devtools::install_github("edzer/sfr").`
]
**sf** incorporates the functionality of the 3 main packages of the **sp** paradigm (**sp** [@R-sp] for the class system, **rgdal** [@R-rgdal] for reading and writing data, **rgeos** [@R-rgeos] for spatial operations undertaken by GEOS) in a single, cohesive whole.
This is well-documented in **sf**'s [vignettes](http://cran.rstudio.com/package=sf):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("sf1") # for an introduction to the package
vignette("sf2") # for reading, writing and converting Simple Features
vignette("sf3") # for manipulating Simple Features
```

As the first vignette explains, simple feature objects in R are stored in a data frame, with geographic data occupying special column, a 'list-column'. This column is usually named 'geom' or 'geometry'.
A 'real world' example is loaded by the **spData** package, which loads the `world` object:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(spData)
data("world")
```

In the above code **spData** silently loaded the `world` dataset (and many other spatial datasets - see [nowosad/spData](https://nowosad.github.io/spData/) for a full list).
The dataset contains spatial and non-spatial information, as shown by the function `names()`, which reports the column headings in data frames. 
This can be seen as the final column name of `world`:

```{r}
names(world)
```

It is the contents of this modest-looking `geom` column that gives `sf` objects their spatial powers.
It's actually a list-column, containing all the coordinates needed to plot the result as a map using the `plot()` method, the results of which are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:world-all).

```{r world-all, fig.cap="A spatial plot of the world using the sf package, with a facet for each attribute."}
library(sf) # must be loaded to plot sf objects
plot(world)
```

Note that instead of creating a single map, as most GIS programs would, the `plot()` command has created multiple maps, one for each variable in the `world` datasets.
This behavior can be useful for exploring the spatial distribution of different variables and is discussed further in \@ref(basic-map) below.

Being able to treat spatial objects as regular data frames with spatial powers has many advantages, especially if you are already used to working with data frames.
The commonly used `summary()` function, for example, provides a useful overview of the variables within the `world` object, but prefixed with some information about the object's spatial component:

```{r}
summary(world["lifeExp"])
```

The result provides a quick summary of both the non-spatial and spatial data contained in `world`: the average life expectancy of countries is 73 years (ranging from less than 50 to more than 80 years) and there are 177 countries represented by the `MULTIPOLYGON` geometry type which has a geographical (longitude/latidue) coordinate reference system (CRS) with an EPSG code of `4326`.

<!-- TODO: cross-reference section covering CRSs. -->

Note that by appending `["lifeExp"]` onto the object name in the previous code chunk, only the relevant column was summarized.
We explore such 'attribute operations' in Chapter \@ref(attr).
First, it's worth taking a look at the basic behavior and contents of this simple feature object, which can usefully be thought of as a '**S**patial data**F**rame).

`sf` objects are easy to subset.
The code below shows its first 2 rows and 3 columns.
The output shows 2 major differences compared with a regular `data.frame`: the inclusion of additional geographic data (`geometry type`, `dimension`, `bbox` and CRS information - `epsg (SRID)`, `proj4string`), and the presence of final `geometry` column:

```{r}
world[1:2, 1:3]
```

All this may seem rather complex, especially for a class system that is supposed to be simple.
However, there are good reasons for organizing things this way and using **sf**.

#### Exercises

What does the summary of the `geometry` column tell us about the `world` dataset, in terms of:

- The geometry type?
- How many countries there are?
- The coordinate reference system (CRS)?

### Why Simple Features?

There are many advantages of **sf** over **sp**, including:

- Faster reading and writing of data (more than 10 times faster in some cases)
- Better plotting performance
- **sf** objects can be treated as dataframes in most operations
- **sf** functions can be combined using `%>%` operator and works well with the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) collection of R packages
- **sf** function names are relatively consistent and intuitive (all begin with `st_`) compared with the function names and syntax of the **sp**, **rgdal** and **rgeos** packages that it supersedes.

A broader advantage is that simple features are so well supported by other software products, not least PostGIS, which has heavily influenced the design of **sf**.

A disadvantage you should be aware of, however, is that **sf** is not *feature complete* and that it continues to evolve.
The transition from **sp** to **sf** will likely take many years, and many spatial packages may never switch.
Even if you discover spatial data with R through the **sf** package, it is still worth at least being aware of **sp** classes, even if you rarely use them for everyday geospatial tasks.

Fortunately it is easy to translate between **sp** and **sf** using the `as()` function: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sp)
world_sp = as(object = world, Class = "Spatial")
```

### Basic map making {#basic-map}

Basic maps in **sf** can be created quickly with the base `plot()` function. Unlike **sp**, however, **sf** by default creates a faceted plot, one sub-plot for each variable, as illustrated in the left-hand image in Figure \@ref(fig:sfplot). 

```{r sfplot, fig.cap="Plotting with sf, with multiple variables (left) and a single variable (right).", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', warning=FALSE}
plot(world[3:4])
plot(world["pop"])
```

As with **sp**, you can add layers to your maps created with `plot()`, with the argument `add = TRUE`.^[In
fact, when you `plot()` an **sf** object, R is calling `sf:::plot.sf()` behind the scenes.
`plot()` is a generic method that behaves differently depending on the class of object being plotted.]
To illustrate this, and prepare for content covered in chapters \@ref(attr) and \@ref(spatial-data-operations) on attribute and spatial data operations, we will subset and combine countries in the `world` object, to create a single object that represents Asia:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
asia = world[world$continent == "Asia",]
asia = st_union(asia)
```

We can now plot the Asian continent over a map of the world.
Note, however, that this only works if the initial plot has only 1 layer:

```{r asia, out.width='50%'}
plot(world["pop"])
plot(asia, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

This can be very useful for quickly checking the geographic correspondence between two or more layers: 
the `plot()` function is fast to execute and requires few lines of code, but does not create interactive maps with a wide range of options.
For more advanced map making we recommend using a dedicated visualisation package such as **tmap**, **ggplot2**, **mapview**, or **leaflet**.
<!-- TODO: cross reference advanced mapping chapter -->

<!-- 
- plot() function 
- map export 
-->

<!-- Maybe show also somewhere that `world[0]` produces only a plot of the geometry which is rather useful if you do not want to plot a specific attribute. This way, you can for example dismiss the col = "white"-argument in your Nigeria example. -->

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
plot(africa[0], lwd = 3, main = "Nigeria in context", border = "lightgrey")
```

#### Challenge

Using **sf**'s `plot()` command, create a map of Nigeria in context, building on the code that creates and plots Asia above (see Figure \@ref(fig:nigeria) for an example of what this could look like). 

- Hint: this used the `lwd`, `main` and `col` arguments of `plot()`. 
- Bonus: make the country boundaries a dotted grey line.
- Hint: `border` is an additional argument of `plot()` for **sf** objects.

```{r nigeria, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of Nigeria in context illustrating sf's plotting capabilities"}
nigeria = world[world$name_long == "Nigeria",]
africa = world[world$continent == "Africa",]
bb_africa = st_bbox(africa)
plot(africa[2], col = "white", lwd = 3, main = "Nigeria in context", border = "lightgrey")
# plot(world, lty = 3, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(world, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(nigeria, col = "yellow", add = TRUE, border = "darkgrey")
ncentre = st_centroid(nigeria)
ncentre_num = st_coordinates(ncentre)
text(x = ncentre_num[1], y = ncentre_num[2], labels = "Nigeria")
```

#### Further work

**sf** makes R data objects more closely aligned to the data model used in GDAL and GEOS, in theory making spatial data operations faster.
The work here provides a taste of the way **sf** operates but there is much more to learn (see Chapter \@ref(spatial-data-operations)). And there is also a wealth of information in the highly recommended vignettes of the package.

As a final exercise, we'll see one way of how to do a spatial overlay in **sf**. First, we convert the countries of the world into centroids, and then subset those in Asia. Finally, the `summary`-command tells us how many centroids (countries) are part of Asia (43) and how many are not (134).

```{r}
world_centroids = st_centroid(world)
sel_asia = st_intersects(world_centroids, asia, sparse = FALSE)
summary(sel_asia)
```

Note: another way of achieving the same result is with a GEOS function for identifying spatial overlay, which we'll cover in more detail in Chapter \@ref(spatial-data-operations).

**sf**'s `plot()` function builds on base plotting methods, allowing access to its many optional arguments (see `?plot`).
This provides powerful but not necessarily intuitive functionality, as illustrated by the variable circle sizes generated by the `cex` argument (see Figure \@ref(fig:africa), generated by the code below).

```{r africa, fig.cap="Centroids representing country population, diameter being proportional to population.", warning=FALSE}
plot(world["continent"])
plot(world_centroids, add = TRUE, cex = world$pop / 1e8, lwd = 3)
```

<!-- More appropriate for subsequent chapters. -->
<!-- This shows that there are 43 countries in Asia -->
<!-- We can check if they are the same countries as follows: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- africa_centroids2 = world_centroids[sel_africa,] -->
<!-- identical(africa_centroids, africa_centroids2) -->
<!-- ``` -->

#### Exercises

- What does the `lwd` argument do in the `plot()` code that generates Figure \@ref(fig:africa). 
- Perform the same operations and map making for another continent of your choice.
- Bonus: Download some global geographic data and add attribute variables assigning them to the continents of the world.

### Simple feature classes {#sf_classes}

To understand new data formats in depth, it often helps to generate them for first principles.
This section walks through vector spatial classes step-by-step, from the elementary simple feature geometry to simple feature objects, with class `sf`, representing complex spatial data.
Before describing each geometry type that the **sf** package supports it is worth taking a step back to understand the building blocks of `sf` objects. 
As stated in section \@ref(intro-sf), simple features are simply dataframes with at least one special column that makes it spatial.
These spatial columns are often called `geom` or `geometry` and can be like non-spatial columns: `world$geom` refers to the spatial element of the `world` object described above.
These geometry columns are 'list columns' of class `sfc`: they are simple feature collections.
In turn, `sfc` objects are composed of one or more objects of class `sfg`: simple feature geometries.

To understand how the spatial components of simple features work, it is vital to understand simple feature geometries.
For this reason we cover each type currently supported `sfg` in the next sections before moving to describe how they can be combined to form `sfc` and eventually full `sf` objects.

#### Simple feature geometry types {#geometry}

<!-- This section demonstrates how the full range of geometry types supported by the **sf** package can be created, combined and plotted. -->
Geometries are the basic building blocks of simple features.
Simple features could be represented as one of the 17 geometry types using the **sf** package.
In this chapter we will focus on seven, the most commonly used, simple features types: `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `POLYGON`, `MULTIPOINT`, `MULTILINESTRING`, `MULTIPOLYGON` and `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`.<!--FIG-->
The whole list of possible feature types could be found in [the PostGIS manual ](http://postgis.net/docs/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html).

Simple features, outside of an R environment, could be represented in one of two ways, ether as a well-known binary (WKB) or well-known text (WKT). 
Well-known binary (WKB) representations are usually hexadecimal strings, which are used to transfer and store geometry objects in databases.
Well-known text (WKT), on the other hand, is a text markup description of simple features. 
Both formats are exchangeable, therefore we would focus only on the well-known text (WKT) representation.

All of the geometry types are built of points. 
Each point could be described as coordinates in a 2D, 3D or 4D space:

- X and Y coordinates represent location of points. It could be either easting and northing or longitude and latitude.
- A Z coordinate denotes altitude.
- An M coordinate ("measure") allows to represent some measure associated to the point, but not the whole feature. 
This coordinate could be a time of measurement, information who measured this point or what's the error of measurement.

As a result, four possible types of points exist - XY (two-dimensional), XYZ (three-dimensional containing altitude), XYM (three-dimensional containing measure) and XYZM (four-dimensional).
They could be easily describes as a well-known text:

- XY - `POINT (5 2)`
- XYZ - `POINT (5 2 3)`
- XYM - `POINTM (5 2 1)`
- XYZM - `POINT (5 2 3 1)`

```{r point, echo=FALSE}
plot(st_as_sfc(c("POINT(5 2)")), axes = TRUE, main = "POINT")
```

A linestring is represented by a sequence of points with linear interpolation between points, for example:

- `LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)`

```{r linestring, echo=FALSE}
plot(st_as_sfc("LINESTRING(1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)"), axes = TRUE, main = "LINESTRING")
```

Linestring cannot have self intersecting line part.
In other words, lines shouldn't pass through the same point twice (except for the endpoint).

A polygon is a sequence of points, where the first and last point have the same coordinates. 
Similarly to linestring, polygon needs to create a non-self intersecting ring.
By the definition, polygon has one exterior boundary (outer ring) and zero or more interior boundaries (inner ring).
These interior boundaries are often known as holes.

- Zero interior boundaries (holes) - `POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5))`

```{r polygon, echo=FALSE}
plot(st_as_sfc("POLYGON((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5))"), col="gray", axes = TRUE, main = "POLYGON")
```

- One hole - `POLYGON ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3, 2 4))`

```{r polygon_hole, echo=FALSE}
plot(st_as_sfc("POLYGON((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3, 2 4))"), col="gray", axes = TRUE, main = "POLYGON with a hole")
```

The next three geometry types are the sets of previous ones: a multipoint is a set of points, multilinestring is a set strings and multipolygon is a set of polygons:

- Multipoint - `MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2)`
- Multistring - `MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 2, 2 4))`
- Multipolygon - `MULTIPOLYGON ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 1 5), (0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2))`

```{r multis, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(st_as_sfc("MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2)"), axes = TRUE, main = "MULTIPOINT")
plot(st_as_sfc("MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 2, 2 4))"), axes = TRUE, main = "MULTILINESTRING")
plot(st_as_sfc("MULTIPOLYGON (((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (0 2, 0 3, 1 3, 1 2, 0 2)))"), col="gray", axes = TRUE, main = "MULTIPOLYGON")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

A geometry collection is the most heterogeneous type.
It could consists of a set of any geometry types previously mentioned, for example:

- Geometry collection - `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2), LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)))`

```{r geom_collection, echo=FALSE}
plot(st_as_sfc("GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2), LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)))"),
     axes = TRUE, main = "GEOMETRYCOLLECTION")
```

#### Simple feature geometry (sfg) objects {#sfg}

Simple feature geometry types are represented in R by objects of a `sfg` class. 
A `sfg` object is a geometry of a single feature - a point, linestring, polygon, multipoint, multilinestring, multipolygon or geometry collection.

Usually you don't need to create geometries on your own. 
In most cases, geometries are read from spatial files.
However, a set of function to create simple feature geometry objects (`sfg`) exists in R and could be used in special cases.
The names of these functions are simple and consistent, as they start with a `st_`  prefix and end with name of geometry types in lowercase letters:

- A point - `st_point()`
- A linestring - `st_linestring()`
- A polygon - `st_polygon()`
- A multipoint - `st_multipoint()`
- A multilinestring - `st_multilinestring()`
- A multipolygon - `st_multipolygon()`
- A geometry collection - `st_geometrycollection()`

In R, `sfg` objects are represented by three native data types:

1. A numeric vector - a single point
2. A matrix - a set of points, where each row contains a point - a multipoint or linestring
3. A list - any other set, e.g. a multilinestring or geometry collection

To create point objects, we could use the `st_point()` function:

```{r}
# note that we use a numeric vector for points
st_point(c(5, 2)) # XY point
st_point(c(5, 2, 3)) # XYZ point
st_point(c(5, 2, 1), dim = "XYM") # XYM point
st_point(c(5, 2, 3, 1)) # XYZM point
```

XY, XYZ and XYZM types of points are automatically created based on the length of a numeric vector. 
Only the XYM type needs to be specified using a `dim` argument.

Multipoint and linestring objects are created based on a matrix using `st_multipoint()` and `st_linestring()` functions:

```{r}
# the rbind function simplify creation of matrices
## MULTIPOINT
multipoint_matrix = rbind(c(5, 2), c(1, 3), c(3, 4), c(3, 2))
st_multipoint(multipoint_matrix)

## LINESTRING
linestring_matrix = rbind(c(1, 5), c(4, 4), c(4, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 2))
st_linestring(linestring_matrix)
```

The rest of objects are represented by lists:

```{r}
## POLYGON
polygon_list = list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5)))
st_polygon(polygon_list)
```

```{r}
## POLYGON with a hole
polygon_border = rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5))
polygon_hole = rbind(c(2, 4), c(3, 4), c(3, 3), c(2, 3), c(2, 4))
polygon_with_hole_list = list(polygon_border, polygon_hole)
st_polygon(polygon_with_hole_list)
```

```{r}
## MULTILINESTRING
multilinestring_list = list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(4, 4), c(4, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 2)), 
                            rbind(c(1, 2), c(2, 4)))
st_multilinestring((multilinestring_list))
```

```{r}
## MULTIPOLYGON
multipolygon_list = list(list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5))),
                         list(rbind(c(0, 2), c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(0, 3), c(0, 2))))
st_multipolygon(multipolygon_list)
```

```{r}
## GEMETRYCOLLECTION
gemetrycollection_list = list(st_multipoint(multipoint_matrix),
                              st_linestring(linestring_matrix))
st_geometrycollection(gemetrycollection_list)
```

#### Simple feature collections {#sfc}

One `sfg` object contains only a single simple feature geometry. 
A simple feature collection (`sfc`) is a list of `sfg` objects with information about a coordinate reference system.
The `st_sfc()` function can be used to create `sfc` objects.
For example, we want to collect two simple features of a point type:

```{r}
# sfc POINT
point1 = st_point(c(5, 2))
point2 = st_point(c(1, 3))
st_sfc(point1, point2)
```

In most cases, an `sfc` object contains objects of identical geometry type.
Therefore, when we combine `sfg` objects of a polygon type we would get `sfc` of a polygon type, and a collection of multilinestring would result into `sfc` of a multilinestring type:

```{r}
# sfc POLYGON
polygon_list1 = list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5)))
polygon1 = st_polygon(polygon_list)
polygon_list2 = list(rbind(c(0, 2), c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(0, 3), c(0, 2)))
polygon2 = st_polygon(polygon_list2)
st_sfc(polygon1, polygon2)
```

```{r}

It is possible to create a `sfc` object from `sfg` objects with different geometry types.
This new object would have a "geometry" geometry type:

```{r}
# sfc GEOMETRY
st_sfc(point1, multilinestring1)
```

<!-- if you want to use it - st_cast() to a proper geometry type -->
<!-- or st_is to select only one geometry type -->
<!-- http://r-spatial.org/r/2017/01/12/newssf.html -->
<!-- methods(class = "sfc") -->

The simple feature collection objects could have more information about spatial data than just geometries.
It is possible to store coordinate reference systems (CRS) in them.
<!-- What's CRS -->
CRS can be represented by `epsg (SRID)` and `proj4string` attributes.
The default value of `epsg (SRID)` and `proj4string` is `NA` (*Not Available*), which is used when the CRS is unknown:

```{r}
st_sfc(point1, point2)
```

The `sfc` object could have `NA` values in both attributes or have an actual value for one or two CRS attributes.
Importantly, all geometries in the `sfc` objects must have the same CRS. 

We can add coordinate reference system as a `crs` argument of `st_sfc()`. 
This argument could accept either an integer with the `epsg` code or character with `proj4string`.

For example, we can set the WGS 84 using either its epsg code (`4326`) or its `proj4string` definition (`"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs"`):

```{r}
# EPSG definition
st_sfc(point1, point2, crs = 4326)
```

```{r}
# PROJ4STRING definition
st_sfc(point1, point2, crs = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")
```

Both of these approaches have advantages and disadvantages. 
An `epsg` code is usually shorter and therefore easier to remember. 
The code also refers to only one, well-defined coordinate reference system. 
It could be, however, considered a limitation of `epsg`, as it is not flexible.
On the hand, a `proj4string` definition is longer - it could specify many different parameters, such as projection type, datum and ellipsoid. 
This makes `proj4string` more complicated, but also allows to create many different projections and modify existing ones.
`proj4string` is also supported by the PROJ.4 software (and therefore by the `sf` package), which enables transformations between different projections.

`epsg` always points to a particular CRS.
This property makes possible for PROJ.4 to convert `epsg` into corresponding `proj4string`.
For example, we can set the UTM Zone 11N projection with `epsg` code `2955`:

```{r}
st_sfc(point1, point2, crs = 2955)
```

As you can see above, the `proj4string` definition was automatically added.
Now we can try to set the CRS using `proj4string`:

```{r}
st_sfc(point1, point2, crs = "+proj=utm +zone=11 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs")
```

The above result doesn't contain `epsg`. 
This is due the fact that no general method for conversion from `proj4string` to `epsg` exists.

#### Simple feature objects {#sf}

Most of the time, geometries are related to a set of attributes. 
These attributes could represent the name of the geometry, measured value, group to which the geometry belongs, and many more.
For example, we measured a temperature of 25°C on the Trafalgar Square in London on June 21^th^ 2017. 
This can be described not only by its coordinates and temperature value, but also by the name of the point, the date of the measurement, it's category (city or village), or if the measurement was made using an automatic station.

The simple feature class, `sf`, is a combination of an attribute table (`data.frame`) and simple feature geometry collection (`sfc`).
Simple features are created using the `st_sf()` function:

```{r}
# sfg objects
london_point = st_point(c(0.1, 51.5))
craggy_island_point = st_point(c(-9.6, 53.0))

# sfc object
our_geometry = st_sfc(london_point, craggy_island_point, crs = 4326)

# data.frame object
our_attributes = data.frame(name = c("London", "Craggy Island"),
                            temperature = c(25, 13),
                            date = c(as.Date("2017-06-21"), as.Date("2017-06-22")),
                            category = c("city", "village"),
                            automatic = c(FALSE, TRUE))

# sf object
sf_points = st_sf(our_attributes, geometry = our_geometry)
```

The above example illustrates the components of `sf` objects. 
Firstly, simple feature geometry (`sfg`) objects are defined using coordinates.
These objects are combined into a simple feature collection (`sfc`).
The `sfc` also stores the information about coordinate reference system.
`data.frame` is created, where each row corresponds to one geometry feature.
Finally, the attribute table and `sfc` object are tied together using the `st_sf()` function.

```{r}
sf_points
```

The resulting object has two classes - `sf` and `data.frame`:

```{r}
class(sf_points)
```

## Units

<!-- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/units/vignettes/measurement_units_in_R.html -->
The final thing to say about `sf` objects in this chapter is that they have units. 
This is illustrated by calculating the area of Nigeria:

```{r}
st_area(nigeria)
```

To translate this figure into a more digestible size, it is tempting to divide the results by a million (the number of square meters in a square kilometer):

```{r}
st_area(nigeria) / 1e6
```

However, the result is incorrectly given in the same units.
The solution is to set the units with the **units** package:

```{r}
units::set_units(st_area(nigeria), km^2)
```

<!-- Something about when units are not set: -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- st_distance(sf_point1, sf_point2) -->
<!-- ``` -->
