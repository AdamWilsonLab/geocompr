## An introduction to Simple Features

Simple Features is an open standard data model developed and endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium ([OGC](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355)) to describe how features with geographical and non-geographical features should be represented.
It is a hierarchical data model that simplifies geographic data by condensing the complex range of possible geographic forms (e.g., line, point, polygon, multipolygon forms) into a single geometry class.

<!-- (Figure \@ref(fig:sf-ogc)). -->

<!-- ```{r sf-ogc, fig.cap="The Simple Features class hierarchy, used with permission (on condition of linking to the source) from the Open Geospatial Consortium's document 06-103r4 (see http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa)", out.width="100%", echo=FALSE} -->

<!-- ``` -->

The R implementation of Simple Features is provided by the **sf** package [@R-sf].
**sf** incorporates the functionality of the 3 main packages of the **sp** paradigm (**sp** [@R-sp] for the class system, **rgdal** [@R-rgdal] for reading and writing data, **rgeos** [@R-rgeos] for spatial operations undertaken by GEOS) in a single, cohesive whole.
This is well-documented in **sf**'s [vignettes](http://cran.rstudio.com/package=sf):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("sf1") # for an introduction to the package
vignette("sf2") # for reading, writing and converting Simple Features
vignette("sf3") # for manipulating Simple Features
```

As the first vignette explains, simple feature objects in R are stored in a data frame, with geographical data occupying special column, a 'list-column'. This column is usually named 'geom' or 'geometry'.
Let's see how simple feature in R work, with reference to world boundary data from the **spData** package:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(sf)
# devtools::install_github("nowosad/spData")
f = system.file("shapes/wrld.shp", package = "spData")
world = st_read(f)
```

This has loaded an object that is simultaneously of class `data.frame` and `sf`:

```{r}
class(world)
```

The output of the preceding command shows that objects with class `sf` are also data frames. Thus, they can be treated like regular `data.frame`, making life easy if you are already used to working with data frames.

Let's look the first 2 rows and 3 columns of this object.
The output shows 2 major differences compared with a regular `data.frame`: the inclusion of additional geographical data (`geometry type`, `dimension`, `bbox` and CRS information - `epsg (SRID)`, `proj4string`), and the presence of final `geometry` column:

```{r}
world[1:2, 1:3]
```

All this may seem rather complex, especially for a class system that is supposed to be simple.
However, there are good reasons for organizing things this way and using **sf**.

### Exercises

What does the summary of the `geometry` column tell us about the `world` dataset, in terms of:

- The geometry type?
- How many countries there are?
- The coordinate reference system (CRS)?

## Why Simple Features?

There are many advantages of **sf** over **sp**, including:

- Faster reading and writing of data (more than 10 times faster in some cases)
- Better plotting performance
- **sf** objects can be treated as dataframes in most operations
- **sf** functions can be combined using `%>%` operator and works well with the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) collection of R packages
- **sf** function names are relatively consistent and intuitive (all begin with `st_`) compared with the function names and syntax of the **sp**, **rgdal** and **rgeos** packages that it supersedes.

A broader advantage is that simple features are so well supported by other software products, not least PostGIS, which has heavily influenced the design of **sf**.

A disadvantage you should be aware of, however, is that **sf** is not *feature complete* and that it continues to evolve.
The transition from **sp** to **sf** will likely take many years, and many spatial packages may never switch.
Even if you discover spatial data with R through the **sf** package, it is still worth at least being aware of **sp** classes, even if you rarely use them for everyday geospatial tasks.

Fortunately it is easy to translate between **sp** and **sf** using the `as()` function, even when **sp** is not loaded: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world_sp = as(object = world, Class = "Spatial")
```

## Basic map making {#basic-map}

Basic maps in **sf** can be created quickly with the base `plot()` function. Unlike **sp**, however, **sf** by default creates a faceted plot, one sub-plot for each variable, as illustrated in the left-hand image in Figure \@ref(fig:sfplot). 

```{r sfplot, fig.cap="Plotting with sf, with multiple variables (left) and a single variable (right).", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', warning=FALSE}
plot(world)
plot(world["population"])
```

As with **sp**, you can add layers to your maps created with `plot()`, with the argument `add = TRUE`^[In
fact, when you `plot()` an **sf** object, R is calling `sf:::plot.sf()` behind the scenes.
`plot()` is a generic method that behaves differently depending on the class of object being plotted.].
However, this only works if the initial plot has only 1 layer (result not shown):

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
plot(world["population"])
africa = world_continents[1, ]
plot(africa, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

This can be very useful when quickly checking the geographic correspondence between two or more layers.
These plots work well for gaining a quick understanding of the data with few lines of code.
For more advanced map making we recommend using a dedicated visualisation package such as **tmap**, **ggplot2**, **mapview**, or **leaflet**.

### Challenge

Using **sf**'s `plot()` command, create a map of Nigeria in context, like the one presented in figure \@ref(fig:nigeria). 

- Hint: this used the `lwd`, `main` and `col` arguments of `plot()`. 
- Bonus: make the country boundaries a dotted grey line.
- Hint: `border` is an additional argument of `plot()` for **sf** objects.

```{r nigeria, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of Nigeria in context illustrating sf's plotting capabilities"}
nigeria = filter(world, name_long == "Nigeria")
bb_africa = st_bbox(africa)
plot(africa[2], col = "white", lwd = 3, main = "Nigeria in context", border = "lightgrey")
# plot(world, lty = 3, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(world, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(nigeria, col = "yellow", add = TRUE, border = "darkgrey")
ncentre = st_centroid(nigeria)
ncentre_num = st_coordinates(ncentre)
text(x = ncentre_num[1], y = ncentre_num[2], labels = "Nigeria")
```

### Further work

**sf** makes R data objects more closely aligned to the data model used in GDAL and GEOS, in theory making spatial data operations faster.
The work here provides a taster of the way that **sf** operates but there is much more to learn (see Chapter \@ref(spatial-data-operations)).
There is a wealth of information that is available in the package's vignettes: these are highly recommended.

As a final exercise, we'll see how to do a spatial overlay in **sf** by first converting the countries of the world into centroids and then subsetting those in Africa:

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Centroids in Africa"}
world_centroids = st_centroid(world)
plot(world_centroids[1])
africa_centroids = world_centroids[africa,]
plot(africa_centroids, add = TRUE, cex = 2)
```

Note: another way of acheiving the same result is with a GEOS function for identifying spatial overlay:

```{r}
sel_africa = st_covered_by(world_centroids, africa, sparse = FALSE)
summary(sel_africa)
```

This shows that there are 56 countries in Africa.
We can check if they are the same countries as follows:

```{r}
africa_centroids2 = world_centroids[sel_africa,]
identical(africa_centroids, africa_centroids2)
```

### Exercises

- Perform the same operations and map making for another continent of your choice.
- Bonus: Download some global geographic data and add attribute variables assigning them to the continents of the world.
